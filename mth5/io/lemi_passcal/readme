Hi Jared,

After chatting more with Bruce, we decided that we should go ahead and share with you the modules handling the parsing of the ASCII files as outputted by the LEMI-424 data logger (see attached). We want to reiterate that these modules haven't been fully tested and reviewed yet and they might be subject to some minor changes.

Details regarding the formatting of the ASCII files can be found in the LEMI manual I sent out a few days ago. Let us know if you have any questions.

Best,
Maeva
